//When writing software I often find myself heading down a direction to solve one problem when I realize that
//there is a better solution to try, or I see another problem that I must resolve first.  Since I am a one
//person company, I often use the readme.md file as a temporary scratchpad where code can be placed aside.
//With a public or shared repository like this one, the readme is not the best place for it.  I will use this
//file as that scratchpad, checking it into the repository because it will sometimes contain content that I
//want to keep persisted and associated with this project.  That way when I get pulled off to go work on other
//projects, I will know exactly where I left off.
        

//Notes to self
- Figure out or log a potential issue where custom controls that inherit from other controls such as a grid, only work in XAML, not code behind.  Code behind throws exceptions.  See the WindowRoot control.
- Determine if I should open a discussion or issue regarding the infinite DPI change events firing.  If I do I need to create a small project that can most easily reproduce the problem.
