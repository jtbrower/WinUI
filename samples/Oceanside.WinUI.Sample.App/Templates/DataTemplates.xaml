      NOTICE HOW TO INCLUDE THIS DICTIONARY 
      Note that this ResourceDictionary has a code behind file that requires you to include
      this resource dictionary differently than you are probably use to.  Assuming that 
      "templates" is the namespace pointing to this dictionary you would do the following
      in your App.xaml
      
      NOTE THAT THE FOLLOWING LINE IS CORRECT
      <templates:DataTemplates />
      
      NOTE THAT THE FOLLOWING LINE IS WRONG
      <ResourceDictionary Source="ms-appx:///Oceanside.WinUI.Base/Templates/DataTemplates.xaml" />

    <!-- The application's main page is DataTemplated here. -->
    <DataTemplate x:Key="MainPageVm" x:DataType="vm:MainPageVm">
        <view:MainPage Vm="{Binding}" />
    </DataTemplate>
